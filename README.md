# Shiny for Bridgewater
#### by Next Level Analytics

Shiny enables you to write powerful interactive web applications entirely in R. Using R, you create a user interface and server, and Shiny compiles your code into the HTML, CSS and JavaScript needed to display your application on the web. What makes a Shiny app particularly powerful is that it can execute R code on the backend so your app can perform any R calculation you can run on your desktop. Perhaps you want your app to slice and dice a dataset based on user inputs? Or maybe you want your web app to run linear models, GAMs or machine learning methods on user-selected data? In either case, Shiny can help.

Creating and running simple web applications is relatively easy and there are great resources for doing this. But when you want more control of the application functionality, understanding the key concepts is challenging. To help you navigate the creation of satisfying Shiny applications we've assembled example code below that demonstrates some of the key concepts.

To run Shiny and follow the code on this post, make sure you have the RStudio application and the `shiny` R package. Additional details on package versions are at the end.
