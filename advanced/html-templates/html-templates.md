# HTML templates

Some developers feel more comfortable writing HTML code directly rather than writing in R and having Shiny compile code to HTML. To meet this need, RStudio introduced the concept of HTML templates that allow you to write the HTML and include placeholders for Shiny input using curly braces. If you're comfortable with web development, the concept will be familiar (e.g. mustache, handlebars).
