# More on reactive programming

Joe Cheng, the primary creator of Shiny, gave a great talk on reactive programming at the Shiny Developers Conference in January 2016. The videos are [now online](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/shiny-developer-conference/) and it is highly recommend you watch both part 1 and part 2.
