# shinyURL

The `shinyURL` package, created by [Andrzej Ole≈õ](https://github.com/aoles), allows you to save and restore the state of your shiny apps if you want to share not just the app, but a particular page in the app. See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/aoles/shinyURL) for more details. His talk on the package at the 2016 Shiny Developers Conference is also worth watching.
